#this is my challenge 03


In the following activity, I was asked to add three functions to complete the exercise. I sorted them alphabetically as requested and implemented a salary comparison to verify that the entered salary is a number. Additionally, users are prompted to input their first name, last name, and salary. At the end, they are asked if they want to add another employee. If they choose to add another employee, they are prompted again for the required information (first name, last name, and salary). Otherwise, the inquiry ends, and our array is displayed. In the console, we can see the messages used to congratulate our randomly selected employee and the number of employees in our array. Furthermore, we have the calculation for the average salary among all employees.
